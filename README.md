# Class Clustering COVID-19 Genome Subtypes With Feature Extraction

## Important Update!
**This repository originally contained PCA class clustering of COVID-19 alignments. The code was based off the current Kaggle competitions. I found on 5/1/2020 that the original algorithm was only clustering the cDNA sequence samples based on their labels, which give no distinguishing information for clustering details of the sequences themselves. The algorithms work, yet the input was flawed.** 

**The algorithms, instruction, and output in this repository now exhibit clustering and analysis of the cDNA sequences of COVID-19.**
